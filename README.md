Our PHP and MySQL Login & Registration System utilizes PHP for server-side scripting to handle user registration, login, and session management. PHP securely processes user input, hashes and stores passwords in a MySQL database, and manages user sessions for a seamless authentication experience. MySQL is employed as the relational database to store user account details securely. The system ensures that new user registrations are validated through email confirmation, and it also includes a password reset feature for user convenience. By following our installation guide, you can easily set up the environment and leverage this system to implement robust user authentication in your web applications
